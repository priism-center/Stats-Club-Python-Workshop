# 1: Anaconda   
The easiest way to download everything that you will need is to download Anaconda (Python 3.7 version), here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
  
This will automatically download Python, Jupyter, Spyder, and a number of useful Python packages. If you prefer to download these things separately, links are below.
   
# Python     
Can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
  
# Jupyter Notebooks    
Use pip3 in the terminal:   
-You shouldn't need to download pip because it comes with recent Python versions, but just in case, directions are here: https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/   
-Then, in the terminal, type:  
pip3 install --upgrade pip  
pip3 install jupyter  
More directions here: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html   

# Installing Packages   
If you need to install additional packages (in case they don't come with Anaconda or if you didn't download Anaconda, you can install them using pip3)   
For example, to install numpy, you would type the following into your terminal:   
pip3 install numpy
